# Project Notes

- This project was developed as a university group assignment.
- The primary objective is to demonstrate basic web development concepts rather than building a production-level system.
- The application runs on a local server environment (XAMPP/WAMP).
- Database functionality is implemented using MySQL and phpMyAdmin.
- The provided SQL file contains initial sample data for testing purposes.
- Any changes made directly to the SQL file will not affect the application unless the database is re-imported.
- The project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and learning outcomes.
- All features were implemented collaboratively by the project team.

## Important
- Database credentials may need to be configured depending on the local environment.
- The application is intended for educational use only.
